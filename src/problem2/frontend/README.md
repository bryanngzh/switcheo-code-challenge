# Problem 2
This project is a simple user interface that is built with ReactJS and ChakraUI that allows users to enter an ETH address,
amount to send and an OTP to confirm the transaction. After filling up all the relevant details, they can press send
and there will be a loading animation shown, followed by a confirmation on the transaction.

## Deployment
This project is deployed on Vercel @ https://switcheo-code-challenge-liart.vercel.app/
